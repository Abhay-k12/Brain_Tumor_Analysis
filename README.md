# 🧠 Brain Tumor MRI Analysis System  
> 🚀 **Finalist at Neural Nexus AI Challenge 2024**  

---

## 📌 Overview  

Welcome to the **Brain Tumor MRI Analysis System** — a deep learning-powered web application that detects brain tumors from MRI scans and classifies them into **four categories**:

- 🩺 **Glioma Tumor**
- 🧠 **Meningioma Tumor**
- 🧬 **Pituitary Tumor**
- ✅ **No Tumor**

This AI model was trained on thousands of annotated MRI images to deliver **accurate, reliable, and real-time tumor classification** via a simple web interface.

## 🎉 Highlights  

✨ Deep Learning powered CNN model (Keras + TensorFlow)  
✨ Image preprocessing with OpenCV for optimized accuracy  
✨ Clean, modern, responsive Flask UI  
✨ Detailed tumor descriptions, symptoms, and treatments for each prediction  
✨ Finalist project at **Neural Nexus AI Model Challenge 2024**
